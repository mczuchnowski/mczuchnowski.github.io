# Rails Acolyte

My personal blog hosted on github pages, available at http://mczuchnowski.github.io

It contains mostly Rails-related posts I wrote down for my own reference. They give some structure
to what I've learned and help me remember how to implement something without going through tons of
code. It's written in a form that is readable and potentially useful to other people as well.

Aside from quick tips and short tutorials I may also publish some longer answers to Treehouse forum
questions that come up often.

Implemented using Jekyll. The blog itself uses modified Emerald theme and the landing page was done
using parts of Jekyll-Uno theme.
